# Embracing an Agile Mindset at Work

### Chapter: 1. Defining an Agile Mindset

Not limited to software projects

### Video: Four Agile Values
4 principles of Agile Manifesto (2001) - challenges of a fixed mindset, long project durations, and poor stakeholder satisfaction:
- Individuals and Interactions > Processes and Tools (strictly following pre-defined processes hinders your ability to change and adapt when needed) 
- Working Software > Comprehensive Documentation (if something that does not make your final product better, don't do it)
- Customer Collaboration > Contract Negotiation
- Respond to Change > Follow a Plan (view change as a necessity rather than considering it a waste of time, effort, and resources)

"What students believe about their brains, whether they see their intelligence as something that's fixed or something that can grow and change, has profound effects on their motivation, learning, and school achievement." (Carol Dweck, Stanford psychologist)

### Video: Growth vs. Fixed Mindset
Keys to Growth Mindset:
- Accept mistakes (mistakes provide an opportunity to improve)
- Fail fast to succeed faster (if the product is imperfect- provide feedback and move forward, fail early and spend time improving rather than spend too much time developing then fail)
- Trust your team (recognize that everyone is learning, keep the communication channel open, and be aware of any life-changing events for your team that may slow down progress)

4 values of the Agile Manifesto are worthless without clear and effective collaboration
Tips for Team Collaboration:
- Have quick, consistent meetings (expectations are conveyed effectively and ideas are shared, what tasks are being completed, and any roadblocks)
- Make your team's work visible (sticky notes, work visualization software, whiteboard - it does not matter where but such that everyone sees it so that feedback can be obtained, and ideas can be shared)
- Hear everyone's opinions regularly (employees trust that their ideas will be treated with respect - it takes a long time, agreement, and consistency from everyone)
